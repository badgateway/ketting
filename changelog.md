ChangeLog
=========

4.0.0 (????-??-??)
------------------

* The old format for OAuth2 setup is now no longer supported.
* It's a best practice to not include polyfills with libraries, so this
  library no longer ships a `fetch` polyfill for Node.js.


3.1.0 (2019-03-28)
------------------

* If Ketting anticipates that a user might want to fetch multiple resources
  in sequence (a follow chain), it will now add `Prefer-Push` header and
  a `Prefer: transclude` header. Both are experimental internet drafts to
  suggest to a server to do a HTTP/2 push or embed a child resource
  respecitvely. This feature is experimental and might change as these drafts
  change.


3.0.2 (2019-03-19)
------------------

* A mistake was made when releasing version 3. A branched was not merged in
  entirely, which caused some of the new OAuth2 features to be partially
  missing. This has now been corrected.


3.0.1 (2019-03-18)
------------------

* Updated dependencies

3.0.0 (2019-03-18)
------------------

* Switched OAuth2 implementation from `client-oauth2` to `fetch-mw-oauth2`.
  This adds support for `authorization_code` auth, removes 11 dependencies and
  reduces the minified Ketting build from 69KB to 28KB.
* OAuth2 options now have a new format. The old format is still supported, but
  will be removed from a future version.
* The `baseHref` propertyname was renamed to `Context` on the `Link` type. The
  new name matches the name from RFC8288. This is a small BC break.


2.5.1 (2019-03-01)
------------------

* #120: The system that de-duplicates identical requests will cache failures
  forever. This is now fixed. Highly recommended update.


2.5.0 (2019-01-22)
------------------

* Basic JSON:API support. Currently only links appearing in the top-level
  document are supported.
* #113: Support for Typescript environments that don't have `esModuleInterop`
  set to true.
* Added a 'go' function for easily getting resources based on relative uris.


2.4.1 (2018-11-07)
------------------

* If a link appears in both `_embedded` and `_links`, they will be
  de-duplicated. HAL technically requires links to appear in both places, so
  scanning `_embedded` should not be needed. However, most implementations will
  not add links `_links` if they were already `_embedded`. This change caters
  both usages.


2.4.0 (2018-11-05)
------------------

* The `Resource` class is now a generic typescript type. This allows a user
  of the library to define specific 'types of resources' and leverage static
 typing for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
* A few documentation updates.


2.3.0 (2018-10-10)
------------------

* Better handling of `Content-Types`. When following HAL links that have a
  `type` parameter, the type is rememebered and used in `Accept` and
  `Content-Type` headers, for `GET`, `PUT` and `POST` requests.
* If no `type` was provided, it will use the last `Content-Type` header from
  `GET` response.
* If that `GET` request never happened, it uses the first 'default'
  `Content-Type` from client.contentTypes, and enumerates all mime-types from
  that list for `Accept` headers.
* No longer incorrectly sends `text/plain` Content-Types.
* Optimization: If multiple calls are made to ask for a Resource's current
  representation, all these calls are coalesced into one. The big benefit is
  that there are no longer multiple parallel `GET` requests.
* Webpack browser build is set to 'production' mode.
* Fixed: After refreshing an OAuth2 token, the new access token wasn't used.


2.2.1 (2018-09-19)
------------------

* Refreshing OAuth2 tokens without having a refresh_token.
  `client_credentials` in particular shouldn't return a `refresh_token`, so
  for these cases, new access tokens are acquired using a new
  `client_credentials` request.


2.2.0 (2018-09-18)
------------------

* Support for OAuth2 `client_credentials` grant.


2.1.0 (2018-09-14)
------------------

* No longer ships with `cross-fetch` and `whatwg-fetch`. To use this library
  in a browser, you must run this in a browser that supports `fetch` or
  provide your own polyfill.
* Updated dependencies


2.0.4 (2018-09-12)
------------------

* Fixed bug: HAL title values weren't parsed.


2.0.3 (2018-08-23)
------------------

* Exporting 'Resource' for TS purposes.


2.0.2 (2018-08-23)
------------------

* Updated dependencies
* Fixed a typescript definition problem.


2.0.1 (2018-06-17)
------------------

* Same as last build.

2.0.0 (2018-06-17)
------------------

* #71: Total conversion to Typescript.
* BC break: Minified files are now in the `browser/` directory, not the `dist/`
  directory.
* #78: Webpack build had a broken version of `querystring`, which caused
  `Link:` header parsing to fail in browsers.
* #80: `resource.fetch()` would throw an exception with some combinations
  of arguments.
* #90: `get()` and `refresh()` will now throw an Error when a server did not
  include a content-type.
* #89: Refactored OAuth utility to be a bit more clear.
* #83: Support for `resource.patch()`. The implementation is pretty basic. Let
  us know how you would like to use it!


1.1.0 (2018-04-07)
------------------

* #70: Moved all source from `lib/` to `src/`. This is prepping for typescript
  support.
* #73: Mocha tests can now be ran in a browser.
* #76: Fixed a browser bug: Headers is not a constructor.


1.0.0 (2018-03-25)
------------------

* #66: Support for Accept header weighing with the q= parameter.
* #68: Updated all dependencies to their latest version.


0.10.3 (2018-01-31)
-------------------

* #63: It was not possible to expand templated links with variables after more
  than one chained hop. (@mhum).


0.10.2 (2018-01-31)
-------------------

* #62: It was not possible to override headers such as `Content-Type` when
  calling `Resource.fetch()`, if these were also set in the `fetchInit`
  defaults. (@mhum).


0.10.1 (2018-01-31)
-------------------

* #60: Chaining more than 2 `follow` statements did not work.


0.10.0 (2017-11-16)
-------------------

* #19: Support for OAuth2 access and refresh tokens. When used, the library
  can automatically refresh the access token if the previous one expired. It
  can also supports the `client_credentials` OAuth2 grant (@mhum).


0.9.0 (2017-09-23)
------------------

* #52: Now using the new URL object in browsers for resolving relative urls,
  and falling back to a DOM based url resolving mechanism if it's not
  available. This causes the browser distribution to drop another 10KB to
  46KB.
* Moved a bunch of utility objects into a `util/` directory, so it's more
  clear what the important API's are.
* #55: Fixed another problem related to the fetchInit function in firefox.


0.8.3 (2017-09-10)
-----------------

* Including the sourcemap file in the NPM distribution.


0.8.2 (2017-09-10)
-----------------

* #53: Regression related to the new 'fetchInit' option.
* Now generating source maps.


0.8.1 (2017-09-04)
------------------

  settings such as `credentials: include` may be passed.


0.8.0 (2017-08-28)
------------------

* #49: Removed support for expanding CURIEs in HAL. This was in conflict with
  the HAL standard. The canonical relation type is the prefix in the REL, not
  the expanded CURIE uri.


0.7.1 (2017-08-24)
------------------

* Lots of documentation updates.
* Including web distribution in NPM package.


0.7.0 (2017-08-21)
------------------

* This library is now called Ketting. It used to be called Restl. Ketting is
  the dutch word for chain.
* Automatically expanding Curies in the HAL `_link` object.


0.6.0 (2017-08-20)
------------------

* #15: Browser support via webpack!
* #45: Removed Bluebird dependency.
* #16: Parsing the HTTP `Link` header (RFC5988).
* #30: Added support for automatically parsing `application/problem+json` error
  responses and throwing better exceptions. (RFC7807).
* #47: Link object now uses an object as its only constructor argument.


0.5.0 (2017-08-08)
------------------

* #41: Support for parsing HTML5. The library can now extract `link` and `a`
  elements with `rel` attributes.
* Removed the `accept` option. This should now be controlled with the
  `contentTypes` property.
* #40: Removed support for the Requests library. This library now only used
  the Fetch API, to make it compatible with browsers in the future.


0.4.2 (2017-08-03)
------------------

* #39: Making it easier to fire off custom HTTP requests on a resource using
  the Fetch API. You can now just provide the `init` argument without providing
  a url.


0.4.1 (2017-07-07)
------------------

* #38: Add HTTP response to HTTP-related exceptions.


0.4.0 (2017-07-07)
------------------

------------------

* #27: Fixed exception messages, they missed the HTTP status code.


0.2.0 (2017-04-21)
------------------

* #17: Now using the Fetch API instead of the requests library. The requests
  library is kept around for BC purposes, but this will eventually be removed.
* #25: the resourceCache was accidentally shared between Client instances.


0.1.2 (2017-04-19)
------------------

* #11: Added test framework.
* #11: Added `follow()` function on Client object for an easy shortcut.


0.1.1 (2017-04-03)
------------------

* #10: Returning the response body from the `refresh()` function, similar to
  `GET` but cache-defeating.


0.1.0 (2017-02-13)
------------------

* #7: Strip `_embedded` and `_links` from `Representation.body`. They are
  already available through `Representation.embedded` and
  `Representation.links`.
* Added a cache for resources in the Client object, which ensures that if you
  request the same resource twice, you'll end up with the same object.
* #6: Automatically parse `_embedded` and treat items in this object as real
  resources.
* Fixed a bug in `post()`.
* Allowing custom headers to be set, and allowing default headers to be
  overridden.

* Linting with eslint.


0.0.3 (2017-02-06)
------------------

* Now using Bluebird for promises, so we can extend them.
* #2: Custom requests are now possible on `Resource` objects.
* #3: Promises returned from `follow()` now have a `follow()` function
  themselves, making it extremely easy to hop from link to link.
* Added a `post()` method for making new resources. This function returns a
  `Resource` object again if the response contained a `Location` header.
* #4: Things in the `_embedded` property are now also treated as links and can
  be followed.
* The `links()` method on Resource now have a `rel` argument for easy filtering.
* Added a `followAll()` function for getting collections.


0.0.2 (2017-01-03)
------------------

* `PUT` request.
* `DELETE` request.


0.0.1 (2016-12-28)
------------------

* First version!
* Parses HAL `_links`.
* Follows links.
* `GET` requests.
